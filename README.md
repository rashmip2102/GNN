AI-Powered Molecular Property Prediction System
A Graph Neural Network Approach for Toxicity Screening
1. Introduction
This project develops an end-to-end system for predicting molecular properties using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), bridging AI and computational chemistry through:
•	Automated toxicity prediction (12 Tox21 tasks)
•	Interactive visualization (RDKit + Dash)
•	Novel graph-based representation

2. Methodology
2.1 System Architecture
 
2.2 Key Components
A. Data Preparation
•	Dataset: Tox21 (7,831 molecules, 12 toxicity endpoints)
•	Graph Representation
B. GNN Architecture
C. Web Interface
•	File Handling: Accepts SDF/MOL formats
•	Real-Time Processing
3. Novelty
Traditional Approach	The Innovation
Uses molecular fingerprints (ECFP)	Direct graph representation
Requires docking software	Browser-based predictions
Separate tools for visualization & analysis	Unified AI-chemistry pipeline
Technical Advancements:
1.	Hybrid Architecture: First to combine RDKit ↔ PyTorch Geometric ↔ Dash
2.	Explainability: Atom-level importance scores (via Integrated Gradients)
3.	Deployment Ready: Containerized with Docker for lab use
 

Key Data Flow:
1.	User upload → RDKit parsing
2.	Molecular graph construction
3.	GNN inference → Prediction scores
4.	Interactive visualization
